[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fcadence-workflow%2Fcadence-samples.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fcadence-workflow%2Fcadence-samples?ref=badge_shield)

Welcome to the Cadence Samples repository! This collection demonstrates the powerful capabilities of Cadence workflow orchestration through practical, real-world examples. Whether you're new to Cadence or looking to implement specific patterns, these samples will help you understand how to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable workflow applications.

## What is Cadence?

Cadence is a distributed, scalable, durable, and highly available orchestration engine that helps developers build reliable applications. It provides:

- **Reliability**: Automatic retry mechanisms, error handling, and fault tolerance
- **Scalability**: Distributed execution across multiple workers
- **Durability**: Persistent workflow state that survives failures
- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring, tracing, and querying capabilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uber-common/cadence-samples.git && cd cadence-samples
```

2. **Start Cadence Server**
```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/refs/heads/master/docker/docker-compose.yml && docker-compose up --wait
```

This downloads and starts all required dependencies including Cadence server, database, and [Cadence Web UI](https://github.com/uber/cadence-web). You can view your sample workflows at [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088).

3. **Build All Samples**:
```bash
make
```

### Docker Troubleshooting

The `docker-compose` command requires Docker daemon to be running. On macOS/Windows, open Docker Desktop. On Linux, run `sudo systemctl start docker`.

<details>
<summary>Port conflicts</summary>

If you see `Bind for 0.0.0.0:<port> failed: port is already allocated`, find the process using that port:

```bash
lsof -i tcp:<port>
```

To find which container is using it:
```bash
docker ps --format '{{.ID}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Names}}' | grep <port>
```

Stop and remove the conflicting container:
```bash
docker stop <container_id> && docker rm <container_id>
```

Cadence uses these ports: `7833`, `7933`, `7939`, `8000-8003`, `8088` (Web UI), `9042` (Cassandra), `9090` (Prometheus), `3000` (Grafana).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Reset everything</summary>

```bash
docker-compose down
docker ps -a  # check for leftover containers
docker rm <container_id>  # remove if needed
```

Verify with `docker ps` and visit [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088).
